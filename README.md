# ESP8266SlackBot
ESP8266 Arduino to SlackBot

This script is built to connect an Arduino based ESP8266 chip to a slackservice. 
Built as a doorbell bot, this script will announce to a channel that someone is at the front door. 

If your looking for a way to connect an arduino client to Slack via a HTTPS connection this is the script for you. 
Please be aware of the SH1 finger print needed for the HTTPS client as slack will refuse the connection if its not present / valid.
